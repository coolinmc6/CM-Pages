<h1 id="chat-app">Chat-App</h1>

<p>This is just a jQuery Ajax chat app designed to play around with ajax and displaying a chat.</p>

<p>I largely followed this template from my other chat app:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create database</li>
<li>Create div to hold chat</li>
<li>Create form / input elements to input message</li>
<li>Write $.post request to insert chat texts</li>
<li>Write GET request that refreshes every second to get chat, limit 50, order by DESC</li>
<li>Display overflow to scroll</li>
<li>Enter some test chats and confirm it works-</li>
</ol>

<p>Here are a few thoughts:
 - you can&#8217;t have two auto incrementing items in the same table. For me, that means that
 I can&#8217;t have both an a_i ID column AND a timestamp. I CAN, however, insert a string
 using PHP&#8217;s date() method:
<code>php
$date = date('Y:m:d h:i:sa');
// 2016:12:16 08:46:51am
</code></p>

<ul>
<li>getting the database connection to work took longer than it should have. Just use
 the db connection method you are familiar with</li>
<li>binding parameters is not just for security&#8230;inserting anything with an apostrophe
 can screw up the SQL</li>
<li>After creating the database (#1) and chat div (#2), I should manually enter in a
 message or two into the DB and then do the GET request (#5). Doing a select statement
 is always easier and allows me to set up the setInterval and constant update
 functionality</li>
<li>for the PDO function, using variables for the user name and password that are defined
 outside of the db_connect() function doesn&#8217;t work&#8230;despite including the db.php file</li>
<li>I need to learn the try{} catch{} to see what my errors are</li>
</ul>
