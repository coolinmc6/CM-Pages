		The 23rd annual New York State Highway and Public Works Expo will take place on <strong>October 18th, 2017</strong> 
		in the Center of Progress at the New York State Fairgrounds in Syracuse, NY. Free admission tickets are sent to every village, city, town, county and state highway and public works professional in New York State. Exhibitors from around the state and the nation gather each year in Syracuse for the annual Expo that puts them face to face with municipal budget decision makers. Superintendents, Board Members, Engineers, Municipal Contractors... they're all at the Expo! The Expo is held at the peak of the annual budget decision making process in municipalities across the state... A great time to showcase what you sell, make new contacts, introduce new products and strengthen relationships with your existing municipal customers!

		Superintendent's Profile and Product-Service Directory magazine, published by Profile Publications, has been focused on serving the broad spectrum of highway and public works officials in New York State since 1978. Just like the Superintendent's Profile reaches ALL types and sizes of municipalities, the NYS Highway &amp; Public Works Expo is the only highway and public works focused show in New York State that attracts superintendents and a municipal audience from all types of municipalities... cities, villages, towns, counties, the state DOT and Thruway Authority! You'll get the chance to meet superintendents and other municipal budget decision makers in person, in an environment specifically targeted to their unique needs and interests. Whatever type of highway or public works related equipment, products or services your company sells, the Expo is your most cost effective way to meet your municipal customers and prospects in person!
