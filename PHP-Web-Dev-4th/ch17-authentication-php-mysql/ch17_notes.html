<ul>
<li>asking a user to prove her identity is called authentication</li>
<li>It looks like you can hide passwords like this:</li>
<li>insert into authorized_users values (&#8216;testuser&#8217;, sha1(&#8216;password&#8217;));</li>
<li>This is what it looks like in the table: 5baa61e4c9b93f3f0682250b6cf8331b7ee68fd8</li>
<li>Regardless of whether you store your data in a database or a file, storing the passwords as
plain text is an unnecessary risk.A one-way hashing algorithm can provide better security
with very little extra effort</li>
<li>crypt() is weak, md5() is a little stronger, sha1() is even stronger</li>
<li>Secure Hash Algorithm 1 (SHA&#8211;1.) The PHP function sha1() provides a strong, one-way
cryptographic hash function.</li>
<li>that long string sha1() produces (5baa61e4c9b93f3f0682250b6cf8331b7ee68fd8) cannot be
decrypted and turned back into “password” even by its creator</li>
<li>MySQL can also do the hashing for you&#8230;you can write it into your SQL script:
select count(*) from authorized_users where
 name = &#8216;&#8220;.$name.&#8221;&#8217; and
 password = sha1(&#8216;&#8220;.$password.&#8221;&#8217;);

<ul>
<li>this query looks for people with a username (which I should make sure is unique) and sees
if it equals the hashed password. The result of this query will either be a 1 or a 0 (you are
counting&#8230;)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Hash functions generally return data of a fixed size. In the case of SHA1, it is 40
characters when represented as a string. Make sure that your database column is this width.</li>
<li>Basic authentication -&gt; web servers need authentication for each action but the user doesn&#8217;t
need to enter details in every page/action because it&#8217;s already saved in the browser</li>
<li>this is achieved via PHP or Apache (the web server)</li>
<li>Chapter 18 has more on web security</li>
<li>the PHP method of checking for authentication I don&#8217;t like&#8230;I don&#8217;t want a pop-up requesting
user information (http.php is the file).</li>
<li>pg. 402 is Apache&#8217;s method</li>
<li>The first line of the .htaccess file tells Apache what document to display for visitors who
fail to authenticate (HTTP error number 401).</li>
<li>The line &#8216;AuthUserFile /home/book/.htpass&#8217; tells Apache where to find the file that
contains authorized users’ passwords</li>
<li>As already mentioned, mod_auth is easy to set up with Apache and is effective. Because it
stores users in a text file, it is not really practical for busy sites with large numbers of
users.</li>
<li>p.422 =&gt; installing mod_auth_mysql</li>
<li>More advanced authentication and authorization continues in Chapter 23</li>
<li>Sessions appear to be necessary for password submission via forms because you are going to a
new page. Sessions are used to track variables between pages.</li>
</ul>
