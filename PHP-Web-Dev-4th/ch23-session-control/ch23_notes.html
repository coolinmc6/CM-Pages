<ul>
<li>The idea of session control is to be able to track a user during a single session on a
website.</li>
<li>Sessions in PHP are driven by a unique session ID, a cryptographically random number.</li>
<li>Cookies are a different solution to the problem of preserving state across a number of
transactions while still having a clean-looking URL</li>
<li>A cookie is a small piece of information that scripts can store on a client-side machine.</li>
<li>You can manually set cookies in PHP using the setcookie() function.</li>
<li>If you set a cookie as =&gt; setcookie (‘mycookie’, ‘value’);</li>
<li>you will have access to the cookie via =&gt; $_COOKIE[‘mycookie’].</li>
<li>One tip is that cookie headers must besent before any other headers; otherwise, they
will not work</li>
<li>PHP uses cookies by default with sessions</li>
<li>The basic steps of using sessions are</li>
<li>Starting a session</li>
<li>Registering session variables</li>
<li>Using session variables</li>
<li>Deregistering variables and destroying the session</li>
<li>Starting a Session</li>
<li>The first, and simplest, is to begin a script with a call to the session_start() function</li>
<li>Registering session variables</li>
<li>To create a session variable, you simply set an element in this array, as follows:
$_SESSION[‘myvar’] = 5;</li>
<li>Using Session Variables</li>
<li>Here we are thus far:

<ul>
<li>first start a session calling session_start().</li>
<li>You can then access the variable via the $_SESSION superglobal array—for example,
as $_SESSION[‘myvar’].</li>
</ul></li>
<li>You can check a variable to see whether it is a registered session variable by checking
 in $_SESSION:

<ul>
<li>if (isset($_SESSION[‘myvar’]))</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Deregistering variables and destroying the session</li>
<li>When you are finished with a session variable, you can unset it. You can do this directly
by unsetting the appropriate element of the <span class="math">\(_SESSION array, as in this example:
    - unset(\)</span>_SESSION[‘myvar’]);</li>
<li>after unsetting the variables, do: session_destroy();</li>
<li>After you have used the variable, you unset it.The session still exists, but the variable
$_SESSION[‘sess_var’] no longer exists.</li>
<li>Possibly the most common use of session control is to keep track of users after they
have been authenticated via a login mechanism</li>
<li>STOP =&gt; pg. 517 (in the book, 533 in the pdf)</li>
<li>Chapter 17 -&gt; Implementing Authentication with PHP and MySQL

<ul>
<li>do this first and the come back to finish this chapter&#8230;and THEN chapter 27</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If a form&#8217;s action=&#8217;thispage.php&#8217; is the same page then when the user clicks the submit
button on the form, this script is reinvoked, and you start again from the top.</li>
</ul>
