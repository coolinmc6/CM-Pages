<ul>
<li>The project itself is a bookmarking site with personalization means that based on what they
like, I recommend more shit they&#8217;ll like. Page 569 (585 pdf) has more on the requirements of
the project which I should detail at some point</li>
<li>p. 574 (590 pdf) has the setup for the database.</li>
<li>CM =&gt; I need to learn what index(username) and index(bm_URL) do as well as primary key.</li>
<li>Once I&#8217;ve set these up, I can start coding.</li>
<li>CM=&gt; Copy and paste the items that isn&#8217;t real coding (i.e. references other pages) and code
the actual PHP/SQL</li>
<li>I can&#8217;t access the source code&#8230;google part of the code you want and it&#8217;ll appear</li>
<li>Here&#8217;s an example repo: https://github.com/hankslewis/PHPbookmark</li>
<li>Here&#8217;s another okay source but no code: http://www.roguehangar.com/rogueserver/htdocs/WellingThompson/start.html</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="applicationfiles">Application Files</h2>

<h2 id="bookmark_fns">bookmark_fns</h2>

<ul>
<li>appears to just be a bunch of require_once files</li>
<li>the rationale behind this is because you will need these 5 files &#8220;scripts&#8221; in most pages so it&#8217;s
easier to include one file instead of five</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="login.php">login.php</h3>

<ul>
<li>requires bookmark_fns.php and then has some functions which I guess are all in bookmark_fns</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="output_fns.php">output_fns.php</h3>

<ul>
<li>each of these functions simply output various parts for the page</li>
<li>their format is not what I&#8217;m used to&#8230;I&#8217;ll need to dig in to get a better understanding. From the text:
-The advantages to isolating or removing HTML from your main logic stream are discussed
in Chapter 25,“Using PHP and MySQL for Large Projects.”We use the function API approach here.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="register_form.php">register_form.php</h3>

<ul>
<li>breaking up everything is making a litte more sense&#8230;the do_html_header looks a little better&#8230;the title
of the page is just passed into the function and thus I don&#8217;t need to rewrite a bunch of code.</li>
<li>display_registration_form is from output_fns.php</li>
<li>unlike the pages that I had grown accustomed to making, there are literally four lines of code in this page:</li>
<li>require_once for the bookmark_fns file</li>
<li>Header</li>
<li>Registration form</li>
<li>Footer</li>
<li>each of the displays are in the output_fns file</li>
<li>and as a reminder, the bookmark file just references five other files that I haven&#8217;t written yet at this point
 (p. 578, 594 in the pdf)</li>
<li>CM =&gt; remember this&#8230;..</li>
</ul>
