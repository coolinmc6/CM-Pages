<ul>
<li><p>The project itself is a bookmarking site with personalization means that based on what they
like, I recommend more shit they&#8217;ll like. Page 569 (585 pdf) has more on the requirements of
the project which I should detail at some point</p></li>
<li><p>p. 574 (590 pdf) has the setup for the database.</p></li>
<li><p>CM =&gt; I need to learn what index(username) and index(bm_URL) do as well as primary key.</p></li>
<li><p>Once I&#8217;ve set these up, I can start coding.</p></li>
<li><p>CM=&gt; Copy and paste the items that isn&#8217;t real coding (i.e. references other pages) and code
the actual PHP/SQL</p></li>
<li><p>I can&#8217;t access the source code&#8230;google part of the code you want and it&#8217;ll appear</p></li>
<li><p>Here&#8217;s an example repo: https://github.com/hankslewis/PHPbookmark</p></li>
<li><p>Here&#8217;s another okay source but no code: http://www.roguehangar.com/rogueserver/htdocs/WellingThompson/start.html</p></li>

<h2 id="webapplicationfiles">Web Application Files</h2>

<h3 id="bookmark_fns">bookmark_fns</h3>

<ul>
<li>appears to just be a bunch of require_once files</li>
<li>the rationale behind this is because you will need these 5 files &#8220;scripts&#8221; in most pages so it&#8217;s
easier to include one file instead of five</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="data_valid_fns.php">data_valid_fns.php</h3>

<ul>
<li>contains the filled_out() and valid_email() functions</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="db_fns.php">db_fns.php</h3>

<ul>
<li>db_connect() function.</li>
<li>This function simply provides a single location that contains the username and password
 to connect to the database. That way, if you change the database password, you need to
 change only one file in the application</li>
<li>As a refresher, the new mysqli function takes these parameters:</li>
<li>$result = new mysqli($host, $user, $password, $db_name);</li>
<li>$result = new mysqli(&#8216;localhost&#8217;, &#8216;root&#8217;, &#8216;password&#8217;, &#8216;php_web_dev_4th&#8217;);</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="login.php">login.php</h3>

<ul>
<li>requires bookmark_fns.php and then has some functions which I guess are all in bookmark_fns</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="member.php">### member.php</h2>

<h3 id="output_fns.php">output_fns.php</h3>

<ul>
<li>each of these functions simply output various parts for the page</li>
<li>their format is not what I&#8217;m used to&#8230;I&#8217;ll need to dig in to get a better understanding. From the text:
-The advantages to isolating or removing HTML from your main logic stream are discussed
in Chapter 25,“Using PHP and MySQL for Large Projects.”We use the function API approach here.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="register_form.php">register_form.php</h3>

<ul>
<li>breaking up everything is making a litte more sense&#8230;the do_html_header looks a little better&#8230;the title
of the page is just passed into the function and thus I don&#8217;t need to rewrite a bunch of code.</li>
<li>display_registration_form is from output_fns.php</li>
<li>unlike the pages that I had grown accustomed to making, there are literally four lines of code in this page:</li>
<li>require_once for the bookmark_fns file</li>
<li>Header</li>
<li>Registration form</li>
<li>Footer</li>
<li>each of the displays are in the output_fns file</li>
<li>and as a reminder, the bookmark file just references five other files that I haven&#8217;t written yet at this point
 (p. 578, 594 in the pdf)</li>
<li>CM =&gt; remember this&#8230;..</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="register_new.php">register_new.php</h3>

<ul>
<li>Start the session and then do a series of checks which I believe are custom functions</li>
<li>They are checking a number of things:</li>
<li>completion of the form =&gt; filled_out()</li>
<li>valid email =&gt; valid_email()</li>
<li>password1 equals password2 =&gt; conditional p1 != p2</li>
<li>strength of the password =&gt; 6 &lt; length(p1) &lt; 16</li>
<li>After checking, they attempt to register (which probably checks for uniqueness of user name)</li>
<li>I need to learn how the try-catch logic works as well as the exceptions. Where do they show up? Is it like
a flash message in Rails?</li>
<li>The body of the script takes place in a try block because you check a number of conditions. If any of them
 fail, execution will fall through to the catch block</li>
</ul>
